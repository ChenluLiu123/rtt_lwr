OROCOS RTT on Xenomai
#####################

Orocos RTT is fully compatible with Xenomai, but it needs to be built from source.
Please follow the `installation instructions </install/install.html>`_ to build OROCOS **from source**.

The only difference is the need to set ``export OROCOS_TARGET=xenomai`` before compiling.
